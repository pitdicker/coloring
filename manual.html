<h2>Introduction and Overview</h2>
</a>
 This suite of programs may be used to generate vertex colorings of a graph. 
They are made available on an ``as is'' basis for use by researchers and
 educators.  Please read the <a href="#conditions"> conditions of use</a>
.  
<p> Descriptions of these algorithms and some experimental results can be
found in References <a href="#references"> [1,2,3]</a>
 below. (Available on-line). <b>It is assumed throughout this document that
the reader is familiar with  these papers.</b> </p>
<p> Each of the programs is initiated by </p>
<pre>     program filename<br></pre>
 The file <strong>filename</strong> should contain the graph description in
either the DIMACS standard ASCII format or DIMACS standard binary format. 
Descriptions of these and translators to/from binary formats can be found
in Michael Trick's <a href="http://mat.gsia.cmu.edu/COLOR/instances.html">
 Graph Coloring Instances </a>
. 
<p> The graphs may also include a hidden coloring description, called the
<em>cheat</em> as output by the K-Colorable <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/%7Ejoe/Coloring/Generators/generate.html">
 Graph Generator</a>
. Currently, only the <em>Iterated Greedy</em>(IG) program uses the cheat. 
If the user chooses to use the cheat in IG, then a <em>proximity measure</em>
 is output at regular intervals to indicate how close the coloring is to
the hidden one. Reference <a href="#references">[3]</a>
 provides some analysis based on the proximity measure. For further references
on on this measure, search the <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~joe/Coloring/#Color.bibliography">
 Coloring Bibliography</a>
 for the term <strong>proximity</strong>.  </p>
<p> The final coloring obtained by the program is appended to the file <strong>
filename.res</strong>. For some programs, e.g. <em>Iterated Greedy</em> and
<em>TABU</em>, this result file is also used to select initial colorings. 
 </p>
<p> The final coloring is also <em>verified</em> before writing, with a statement
of verification printed to standard output. Given the complexity of some
of the coloring routines, it is a good idea to check this output, in case
some error should occur. <em>Iterated Greedy</em> and <em>TABU</em> also
verify the input colorings that are selected before starting the coloring
process.  </p>
<p> Each program requires a number of parameters in addition to the graph 
description. These parameters are prompted for interactively  through standard
input and output. Every program first prompts whether or not the user wants
the cheat to be used. </p>
<pre>Do you wish to use the cheat if present? (0-no, 1-yes) <br></pre>
 Only the Iterated Greedy uses it at this time. The next prompt requests
a seed for the random generator.

<h2>A Note on the Source Code Structure</h2>
</a>
 The source code for this program has evolved over a period of about 6 years. 
It was originally designed to accomodate a genetic algorithm, then that was
abandoned, other routines were added, modifications were added, extensions
added then some were deleted, many variations on input controls were tested,
new versions of genetic algorithms were tried, and then for this distribution
what was one large program was split into separate pieces. Partly this was
done to make it easier for the author to use the system as well. Not all
of the algorithms (including the latest GA) are included. 
<p> As a result, the code shows its history.  Careful examination will  reveal
to the reader sections of code that are not used (blocked out by #ifdef's), 
capabilities in current code that are not available in this implementation,
data structures that are not the most efficient match to their current use,
and parameters to routines that are locked down by constant declarations
in mid-stream. </p>
<p> In short, the code has a lot of historical legacy.  Well, it is part
of on-going research into what works and what does not. This publication
of the code is on an as-is basis, and if you wish to modify it or adapt portions
for use elsewhere, you are strictly on your own.  </p>
<p> <strong> PLEASE READ THE <a href="#conditions"> CONDITIONS OF USE</a>
. </strong>  </p>
<p> If your system supports ``make'', first edit the <strong>makefile</strong>
 and change the BINPATH variable to indicate where you wish the output to
go. Then typing  </p>
<pre>    make all<br></pre>
 should create each of the following programs. Reading the <strong>makefile</strong>
 should provide insight as to what  pieces of code are required by each routine. 
 <a name="greedy">
<h2>1. Greedy</h2>
</a>
 Synopsis: 
<pre>	greedy file<br></pre>
  The <strong>greedy</strong> algorithm, also known as the <strong>sequential</strong>
 algorithm, has several variations. For further references, search the  <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~joe/Coloring/#Color.bibliography">
 Coloring Bibliography</a>
 for the term <strong>sequential | greedy</strong>. (The "|" means "OR" to
the search engine). Another term to try is <strong>kempe</strong>. 
<p> The greedy algorithm takes each vertex in turn in some predefined order 
and tries to color the vertex with one of the colors used so far. In other
words, it tries to add the vertex to one of the existing color classes. If
it is not possible to color it with any existing color, then a new color class
is created and the vertex is assigned the color of that class. </p>
<p> This leaves two apparent choices:  </p>
<ul>
 <li><b>first</b> when there is more than one existing color class the vertex
can enter, which one should be chosen; </li>
  <li> <b>second</b> what preordering to assign to the vertices. </li>
</ul>
  
<p> In addition to the cheat and random seed, <strong>greedy</strong> issues
the following prompts.  </p>
<pre>GREEDY TYPE SELECTION<br>        1       Simple Greedy<br>        2       Largest First Greedy<br>        3       Smallest First Greedy<br>        4       Random Sequence Greedy<br>        5       Reverse Order Greedy<br>        6       Stir Color Greedy<br>Which for this program <br></pre>
 This indicates how the program is to make the choice of which color class
to use for the vertex. Each, except for ``Stir Color Greedy''  selects the
first class encountered in the indicated search order. <br>
 
<p> ``Simple Greedy'' visits the classes in order 1..k, and is the technique 
usually indicated when someone refers to the <strong>sequential</strong> algorithm.
 <br>
 ``Largest First Greedy'' ranks the classes by number of vertices currently
in them, and searches by descending size.  This should tend to build larger
independent sets. <br>
 ``Smallest First Greedy'' ranks the classes by number of vertices currently
in them, and searches by ascending size.  This should tend to equalize the
size of the color classes. <br>
 ``Random Sequence Greedy'' searches the sets in a random order. <br>
 ``Reverse Order Greedy'' searches the sets in the order k..1. <br>
 ``Stir Color Greedy'' what the heck does it do? Ahh - read the code, it
does not seem to perform very well anyway.  <br>
</p>
<p> The next prompt is for the ordering of the vertices.  </p>
<pre>Initial Vertex Ordering:<br>        1 -- inorder<br>        2 -- random<br>        3 -- decreasing degree<br>        4 -- increasing degree<br>Using: <br></pre>
 Inorder presents the vertices in the order 1..n, the other three should
be obvious. The inorder may possibly be useful if you think the construction
of your graph could be providing hints to its coloring. 
<p> The last requirement is whether or not to use a Kempe reduction after 
greedy has completed. </p>
<pre>Use Kempe reductions y/n <br></pre>
 Kempe chain reductions are basically done as follows, assuming k colors
have been used and that S[i] refers to the vertices of the <em>i</em>th color
class: 
<pre>For 1 &lt;= i &lt; k, <br>   For i &lt; j &lt;= k do<br>      Compute the induced connected components <br>      of the induced subgraph G[S[i]+S[j]].<br>      Swap the vertices of any component that<br>      has more vertices in S[j] than in S[i].<br></pre>
 See the Reference <a href="#references"> [4] </a>
 for further information.   <a name="dsatur">
<h2>2. DSATUR</h2>
</a>
 Synopsis: 
<pre>	dsatur file<br></pre>
 This program is based on the paper by Daniel Brelaz <a href="#references">
[6]</a>
. It is like the sequential algorithm, except that the order in which vertices 
are chosen is determined dynamically based on the number of colors that cannot
be used because of conflicts with previously colored vertices. Vertices with
the fewest available colors are colored first. 
<p> For further references, search the <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~joe/Coloring/#Color.bibliography">
 Coloring Bibliography</a>
 for the term <strong>dsatur</strong>. </p>
<p> In addition to the cheat and random seed, <strong>dsatur</strong> requires
only one input: </p>
<pre>DSATUR COLORING<br>Initial Vertex Ordering:<br>        1 -- inorder<br>        2 -- random<br>        3 -- decreasing degree<br>        4 -- increasing degree<br>Using: <br></pre>
 This is the secondary selection order used when two or more vertices have 
the same saturation.  <a name="maxis">
<h2>3. MAXIS</h2>
</a>
 Synopsis: 
<pre>	maxis file<br></pre>
 Initially, this program was based on the paper by Bollobas and Thomason
<a href="#references">[6]</a>
 It has evolved somewhat over time. Further descriptions can be found in
the references <a href="#references">[1,2,3,]</a>
. It is also similar to the extremely greedy algorithm  of Manvel<a href="#references">
[7]</a>
 and the XRLF algorithm of Johnson <em>et al</em><a href="#references">[4]</a>
 
<p> MAXIS is based on an exponential backtrack algorithm for finding  a large
maximal independent set. (If given unbounded time, it will find a maximum
set, but for large graphs the user will likely expire first.) These sets
are the color classes. For random graphs in G(n,p) with p=1/2 it is one of
the better algorithms.  However, for sparser graphs it is less effective,
because the  independent sets are larger, meaning the backtrack tree is of
greater depth and of larger branching factor. See <a href="#references">[2]</a>
. </p>
<p> In addition to the cheat and random seed, <strong>maxis</strong> issues
the following prompts. </p>
<p> The backtrack (depth first) search operates by adding vertices one at
a time to an independent set. At each addition, several choices may be available 
as possibilities, and these are the backtrack choices. Since it is impractical
to do a complete search for a maximum independent set, search tree pruning
is  accomplished through the following mechanism.  </p>
<pre>Vertex Num, Cutlim in decreasing order to 0<br></pre>
 In response, supposing a graph of 1000 vertices, the user might input 
<pre>200 2<br>100 3<br>50 4<br>0 2<br></pre>
 This means that if the current set of available vertices has 200 or more 
vertices in it, then limit the choices to the first two (a branching factor
of two). If there are less than 200 but more than 100, then allow up to 3
alternate searches (branching factor of 3), if less than 100 but more than
50 allow 4, and if less than 50 only allow two.  
<p> On a graph of 300 vertices the single response  </p>
<pre>0 3<br></pre>
  may produce a reasonable result fairly quickly.   
<p> </p>
<pre>Backtrack limit = 0 means no limit to backtrack<br>Backtrack limit = k means do not backtrack over first k<br>Upsort limit(U) and Midsort limit(M) with |G| =N<br>        if NumRem &gt; (U*N)/100 then sort by decreasing degree<br>        else if NumRem &gt; (M*N)/100 then sort by medium degree<br>        else sort by increasing degree<br>Enter Backtrack Limit, UpSort Limit, Midsort Limit<br></pre>
 A second pruning occurs with the <em>Backtrack Limit</em>. Suppose that
we have one of the selections for pruning above. Intuitively, since it has
to have <em>some</em> color,  there is no reason to second guess the choice
of the first vertex of a set.  If we set Backtrack limit to 1, then the branching
factor at depth one of the search will be one.  However, intuition has not
been strongly supported by experiments. 
<p> Since we are pruning, and thus doing an incomplete search, heuristics
as to which  branch to choose first will be important for good performance. 
This is controlled in this program through the UpSort and MidSort limits. 
Suppose there are 300 vertices in the current subgraph of a 1000 vertex graph
when the first vertex of the next independent set is to be chosen. Suppose
also that U=75 and M=50 have been entered. </p>
<p> Then, while there are at least 75*300/100 = 225 vertices left as possibilities 
for the next selection, the selection will be by decreasing degree. And when
there are between 150 and 225 possibilities, then selection will be by a
sorting that places midrange degree vertices first. When there are fewer
than 150 vertices, then selection will be in order of smallest degree first. 
</p>
<p> See references <a href="#references">[1,2,6]</a>
 for a discussion of why such choices are important in random graphs.  It
is less clear which choices might be best for other classes of graphs.   <a name="bkdsatur">
<h2>4. Backtrack DSATUR</h2>
</a>
 Synopsis: </p>
<pre>	bktdsat file<br></pre>
  This program is based on a backtrack version of <a href="#dsatur">DSATUR</a>
 with dynamic re-ordering of vertices during backtrack as in Korman's algorithm
<a href="#references">[8]</a>
, but with an attempt at additional heuristic guidance as well, using an
idea similar to the <em>prohibition</em> of Campers <em>et al</em> <a href="#references">
[9]</a>
. (What was the final state of this program?) If the branching factor is
set very large, and no backtrack region is excluded (see below) then this 
algorithm should guarantee an optimal (chromatic number) coloring for small 
graphs. 
<p> In practice the time required to do a backtrack search with this algorithm 
does not produce comparable increases  in quality of solution as is obtained
with similar effort by <a href="#maxis">MAXIS</a>
 or <a href="#itrgrdy">Iterated Greedy</a>
 for most classes of graphs. An exception, noted in <a href="#references">
[3]</a>
 occurs on geometric graphs.  </p>
<p>  In addition to the cheat and random seed, <strong>greedy</strong> issues
the following prompts. </p>
<pre> BACKTRACK DSATUR COLORING<br>Target Color - terminates if achieved: <br></pre>
 If you are searching a <em>k</em>-colorable graph, then this allows termination
if such a coloring is found. Otherwise, enter one to allow a complete search. 
 
<pre>Maximum branching factor: <br></pre>
 Entering a branching factor of <tt>0</tt> causes the algorithm to behave
like DSATUR, essentially performing a sequential search.  For larger values,
<tt>L</tt> when the program backtracks to some point  and takes an alternate
branch, the branching factor is reduced by one for the entire subtree. If
the branch factor at the root of a subtree is <tt>0</tt> then no further
branching is allowed in the subtree.   
<pre>Block off which area<br>  ('x y' means no branching in depth range x to y): <br></pre>
 While working with this program, Papp noticed that for many graphs the only 
improvements that were likely to occur in wider searches occurred  as a result
of alternatives either near the root or near the leaves of the search tree.
Entering a pair of numbers such as <tt>30 280</tt> on a graph of 300 vertices
means that no branching will occur at depths in that range.   
<pre>At each iteration choose vertex of minimum (0) or maximum (1) saturation? <br><br>Find maxclique? (0-no,1-yes) <br><br>Sort vertices by decreasing (0) or increasing (1) degree first?<br><br></pre>
 These prompts allow setting the selection and ordering of vertices. On some
graphs Papp found that using a minimum saturation worked as well as a maximum
(possibly when followed by iterated greedy). 
<p> If the <tt>maximal clique</tt> option is selected, then a subroutine
to find a maximal clique is called. This is similar to the MAXIS program
for finding a maximal independent set, with the obvious flip of meaning for
edges versus non-edges. Once a first clique is found remaining vertices are
sorted by  degree as requested. If no clique is requested, then all vertices
are sorted.  </p>
<pre>Vertex Num, Cutlim in decreasing order to 0<br><br>Backtrack limit = 0 means no limit to backtrack<br>Backtrack limit = k means do not backtrack over first k<br>Upsort limit(U) and Midsort limit(M) with |G| =N<br>        if NumRem &gt; (U*N)/100 then sort by decreasing degree<br>        else if NumRem &gt; (U*M)/100 then sort by medium degree<br>        else sort by increasing degree<br>Enter Backtrack Limit, UpSort Limit, Midsort Limit0<br></pre>
 These options are for the clique finding routine if requested, and are the
same as described in the <a href="#maxis">MAXIS</a>
 section.   <a name="itrgrdy">
<h2>5. Iterated Greedy</h2>
</a>
 Synopsis: 
<pre>	itrgrdy file<br></pre>
 This program is is able to take a previous coloring from  <strong>file.res</strong>
 and then try to improve on it by an iterated local improvement search. If
no coloring is available, then the program uses a trivial n-coloring to start. 
The program generates many colorings, and outputs the best coloring it finds. 
<p>  The method this program uses is to repeatedly call the  <a href="#greedy">
Greedy</a>
 program to find a new coloring. The key idea that makes this worthwhile
doing is that for each call, the ordering of the vertices is determined  by
the previous coloring. This is done in such a way that  it is guaranteed
that each call will produce a new coloring using no more colors than the
previous coloring. Several ways of reordering the vertices are available that
satisfy this criterion.  </p>
<p> This program requires quite a few control parameters.  </p>
<p>  This is the only program (at the time of writing) that uses the cheat
to compute proximity measures. If the use of the cheat is selected, and a
hidden coloring is included in the graph, then this coloring is read into
the program and used to compute the proximity measure with respect to the
current coloring  at regular intervals throughout the search.   </p>
<p> After the cheat is selected the user is asked for a number to seed the
random number generator. Then the following prompts are given: </p>
<pre>Enter target color<br></pre>
 If a coloring is obtained using this or fewer colors, then the program terminates. 
<pre>GREEDY TYPE SELECTION<br>        1       Simple Greedy<br>        2       Largest First Greedy<br>        3       Smallest First Greedy<br>        4       Random Sequence Greedy<br>        5       Reverse Order Greedy<br>        6       Stir Color Greedy<br>For each greedy type, enter its weight for selection:<br></pre>
 These types are the same as described in the <a href="#greedy">Greedy</a>
 section. However, since  the program makes many calls to greedy, it  is
possible to vary which type is used on different calls. 
<pre>Enter weight for 1 100<br>Enter weight for 2 100<br>Enter weight for 3 0<br>Enter weight for 4 50<br>Enter weight for 5 0<br>Enter weight for 6 0<br></pre>
 The selection of greedy type is probabilistic, and the inputs in the above
example would select the simple type  and  the largest first type with probability 
100/250 each,  and would select random with probability 50/250. 
<pre>Enter the frequency for Kempe reductions: <br></pre>
 Kempe reductions are computationally expensive if done on every greedy call, 
and also tend to cause IG to hover around a local minima if used too frequently.
 Entering a number 30 means that the reductions will be done on every 30th 
call. A number in the range 20-50 seems most effective, although larger values
may be appropriate for larger graphs. 
<pre>Enter number of iterations before quitting (after last improvement)<br></pre>
 IG is a local search that can run for an arbitrarily long time. Entering
a value of 1000 here means that 1000 calls to greedy will be made after the
last improvement detected.  The value of a coloring for this  purpose is
called the <strong>color sum</strong> and is  computed as n*k + sum c[v],
where n =|V| is the number of vertices, k is the current coloring number,
and c[v] is the color of vertex v, with the sum taken over all vertices in
|V|.  A discussion of this measure is presented in <a href="#references">
[2]</a>
. Note that although k never increases as IG runs, the coloring sum may increase. 
<p> Suppose that on the 457th call to greedy a coloring sum was found less
than any so far. The program would continue until at least 1457 calls to
greedy  were made. If a new minimum sum were found on 1329, then the program 
would continue on until at least 2329 calls were made. See section <a href="#future">
Future Changes</a>
 for a much needed improvement. </p>
<p> The next set of prompts is concerned with the reordering of vertices between
calls to greedy. The reader is referred to <a href="#references">[1,2]</a>
 for a discussion of these reorderings and their properties. </p>
<pre>REORDER CONTROL INFORMATION<br>Heuristic Controls<br>        1       reverse order (else in order)<br>        2       shuffle<br>        4       largest first<br>        8       smallest first<br>        16      increasing total degree<br>        32      decreasing total degree<br>Sum any subset, sorts [size[degree[shuffle,reverse,order]]]<br><br>Frequency, control - terminate by 0 0<br>100 1<br>100 2<br>50 5<br>0 0<br></pre>
 The inputs in the last five lines above means that with probability 100/250 
the vertices will be sorted so that color classes are in reverse order, with
probability 100/250 the color classes will be randomly shuffled, and with
probability 50/250 the classes will be sorted by decreasing size, with ties
broken by reverse order.   
<pre>[ 1] CLRS 32 FROM DSATUR<br><br>[ 2] CLRS 17 FROM ITERATED GREEDY<br><br>[ 3] CLRS 23 FROM TABU<br><br>[ 4] CLRS 17 FROM ITERATED GREEDY<br></pre>
  The program looks for a file called <strong>file.res</strong>. If found
then the file is scanned and a list of previously obtained colorings is presented.
The user selects the coloring to start the iterated greedy process with. 
<p> If the file <strong>file.res</strong> does not exist, or is empty, then
the program starts with a trivial coloring, coloring the vertices with colors
<em>1..n</em>. </p>
<p> As the program runs, it outputs progress reports. When a reduction in
the color sum occurs, a line beginning ``It='' is printed, with the iteration
number, the current number of colors being uses, and the color sum. When
a reduction in the number of colors used occurs, a line beginning ``COLOR''
is printed with number of colors, iteration number and the CPU time since
the program started. Every 100 iterations, a line starting ``ITR'' is printed
with the iteration number, number of colors and color sum. </p>
<p> In addition, if the cheat is present and requested by the user then proximity
information is printed each time the number of colors is reduced and on every
1000 iterations, as well as at the beginning and end of the run. Typical
lines look like </p>
<pre>P=  761:  0   0   5  12  15  21 191 232 177  20   5  16  20  23  24<br><br>P= 3121: 28  15 120 231 210 300 300 300 276 276 120 231 210 153 351<br></pre>
 These were output during a trial run on a 300 vertex graph with a hidden 
15 coloring in which the color classes varied in size. The first line was
output when a 31-coloring was obtained by the program, and the second was
output when a 15 coloring was found. 
<p> In this instance, there are 15 values printed following the ``:'', one 
for each of the hidden color classes. The number preceding the ``:'' is the
sum of these numbers. Each of the trailing numbers represents the number
of pairs of vertices from the color class that received the same color in
the programs current coloring.  For example, if hidden color class 3 had
vertices <tt>&lt;a,b,c,d,e,f&gt;</tt> and the program assigned color 5 to
<tt>&lt;a,b,e&gt;</tt>, color 9 to <tt>&lt;c,f&gt;</tt> and color 2 to <tt>
&lt;d&gt;</tt>, then the proximity value for hidden class 3 would be 4. </p>
<p> In the above output, first line, classes 1 and 2  each have value 0,
indicating that for each of these classes, no two vertices received the same
color in the 31 coloring obtained by the program. </p>
<p> See reference <a href="#references">[3]</a>
 for an example of how this information can be used to study the coloring
program behavior.  <a name="tabu">
<h2>6. TABU</h2>
</a>
 Synopsis: </p>
<pre>	tabu file<br></pre>
  TABU is another local improvement search. It is based on partitioning the
vertices of a graph into color classes that may not represent a legal coloring,
then attempting to reduce the number of coloring violations, or <em>conflicts</em>
, by moving vertices from one class to another. This program is based on

 for a description of differences from that paper. 
<p>  Some of the differences will be apparent from the requested inputs  listed
below. In addition to the cheat and random seed, <strong>tabu</strong> issues
the following prompts.  </p>
<pre>TABU CONTROL INFORMATION<br>Maximum Iterations for tabu: 1000<br>Enter number of neighbors 100<br>Enter minimum number of neighbors 2<br>Enter tabu list size 7<br></pre>
 Each iteration of TABU consists of generating a sample of neighbors; that
is, partitions that can be obtained from the current one by moving one vertex
to a different class. It then selects the neighbor partition that has the
fewest conflicts, even if the neighbor has more conflicts than the current
partition. The set of neighbors is restricted by a TABU list that prevents
a  vertex from moving back into a class that it was recently a member of
in a previous iteration. This helps the program struggle out of local minima. 
<p> The first input, 1000 in the above example,  limits the number of  iterations
before quitting after the last improvement was detected. That is, if on iteration
247 a new (non-zero) global minimum in conflicts was obtained, then the program
would continue  to at least 1247 iterations before quitting. It will continue
until either there is a sequence of 1000 iterations without improvement, or
the number of conflicts is reduced to 0, indicating that a legal coloring 
has been obtained.  </p>
<p> The second indicates that a maximum of 100 neighbors will be generated. 
TABU immediately stops generating neighbors if one of value lower than the 
current partition is found. However, the third input above indicates that 
this quick change will be limited in that before making the switch, TABU
must examine at least two neighbors of lower value, picking the better of
the two before switching to a new partition.  Finally, in this example a
vertex will not be allowed to move back into  a partition from which it was
previously removed for at least 7 iterations.  </p>
<pre>Enter the target color you  want to try for: 15<br>If target not achieved, how many increases allowed: 2<br></pre>
 The first input tells TABU how many classes to use in the partition of the
vertex set.  The second asks how many times the program should increase the
number of classes before giving up. For example, for the values above TABU
will first try to find a 15 coloring, if that fails then it will  increase
the partitioning to 16 classes by adding an empty class, and try for a 16
coloring. If that fails, then it will add another empty class and try for
a 17 coloring. If that fails, it will take the current partitioning as an
ordering heuristic, apply the simple greedy algorithm and output that as
its coloring.  
<pre>[ 1] CLRS 32 FROM DSATUR<br><br>[ 2] CLRS 17 FROM ITERATED GREEDY<br><br>[ 3] CLRS 23 FROM TABU<br><br>[ 4] CLRS 17 FROM ITERATED GREEDY<br><br>There are 4 colorings. Which do you want? 2<br><br></pre>
 TABU will seed the partition it starts with by using the  largest color
sets from the indicated coloring as color classes, and then taking the remaining
vertices and placing them one by one into the class in which they cause the
fewest conflicts. For the example inputs, the vertices from the two smallest
classes of the second coloring will be inserted into the largest 15 color
classes. The hope is that this will give TABU a better start than a random
partition. Note however that there is no guarantee that TABU will even find
a coloring as good as the initial coloring.    <a name="future">
<h2>Future Changes</h2>
</a>
 Notice that for iterated greedy, the user has less than complete control
over quitting time. One nice feature would be an interrupt handler that would
allow the user to send a signal to IG, cause it to terminate its search,
and output the best coloring found so far. The same is true for TABU.  
<p> The proximity measure should be expanded to allow the values to be computed
as a cross between any two input sets of colorings, not just the cheat, as
a <em>post mortem</em> method of analysis. This would be even more useful
if the cheat were printed separately from the graph, and a further useful
feature of the generator program for evacuation graphs would be to output
the deceptive colorings as well as the hidden one, especially for graphs
with the hidden and deceptive colorings all having the same parameters.
